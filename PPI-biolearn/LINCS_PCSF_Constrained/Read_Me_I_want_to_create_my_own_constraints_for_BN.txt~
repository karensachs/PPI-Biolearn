This file gives instructions on running BL by constraining on any network, and/or parts of the PCSF model, by creating one's own spec file to constrain edges.

The PCSF model comes from Ernest Fraenkel's lab at MIT, and was created by Johnny Li in 2019. The data is from day 18 iMNs.

Folder Contents:
PCSF model:
W_1.00_B_2.00_G_4.50.robust_network.graphml
Script to extract nodes and edges in csv or text files:
extract_edges_fromPCSF.py
Also on colab:

Edges as csv:
extracted_edges_PCSFgraphml.csv (Note: the 2 csv files are identical)
Data in BL friendly format:
Input_Data_100Lines_BL_LINCSpcsf_DS_G_CT_C9nodesMarch28_31.txt
Spec file with constraints (allowing only PCSF edges): LINCS_PCSF_constrained.spec.txt
Using the Sparse Candidate Algorithm (constraines search based on minimal correlation among tuples, faster and more restricted search s\
pace): LINCS_PCSF_constrained_SCAlg.spec.txt
Script for making spec files: 


Instructions:
Run BL (this is the GUI version for unix/MAC OSX, but similar to Windows version, please see BL manual) by typing ./BiolearnInteractive\
Run.sh ./

Choose one of the above spec files (SC algorithm or regular). Edit this file if you'd like a different default name for the output netw\
orks, or you can also edit in the GUI window.

Choose GUI options (optional)
Note that nodes to ignore or constrain can be specified in the GUI to be saved to columnstatus file. See also the Anchornodes directory\
 in the main PPI_BL folder.

Load data file as specified above.

Press "Run"
