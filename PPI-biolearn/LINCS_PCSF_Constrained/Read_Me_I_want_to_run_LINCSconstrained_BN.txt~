This file gives instructions on running BL on pre-created files, that enable running the 100 line data on a BN that is constrained to allow only edges from the PCSF model created from the LINCS data.

The PCSF model comes from Ernest Fraenkel's lab at MIT, and was created by Johnny Li in 2019. The data is from day 18 iMNs.

PCSF model is here: W_1.00_B_2.00_G_4.50.robust_network.graphml
Script to extract edges in csv or text files: extract_edges_fromPCSF.py
