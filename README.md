# PPI-Biolearn

Biolearn is a Bayesian network structure learning program developed in collaboration with the Pe'er lab (https://github.com/dpeerlab/dpeerlab-website/blob/master/biolearn.html, https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/dana-pe-er).

This version allow incorporation of a prior knowledge network that constrains the search space, which facilitates learning in a low sample size, high dimensional realm (i.e. problems in which # of variables outnumber the number of samples.)

The Bayesian network structure learning program learns a sparse representaion of statstical relationships in the data, returning a graphical reprsentation of a sparse joint probability distributon describing the input data, typically measuremnts of genes or proteins, but applicable to any measured variables. The search space is exponential in the number of variables, and the number of samples in molecular biology applications are often small, necessitating appropriate constraints. One useful approach is constraining via use of a prior knowledge network, often a protein-protein interaction network or PPI. 

The prior knowledge network is specified as a 2 column matrix or 2-dimensional array indicating all PPI edges, undirected, with an i,j row indicating the presence of a PPI edge connecting the ith and jth variables. The MATLAB script PPI_spec.m accepts as input the PPI representation and a list of variable names. It outputs a spec file specifying the constraint that all model edges much be draw from the set of PPI edges, and excluding all other edges (setting their proability to 0). The spec file will be called by Biolearn.
