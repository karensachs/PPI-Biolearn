# PPI-Biolearn

Biolearn is a Bayesian network structure learning program developed in collaboration with the Pe'er lab (https://github.com/dpeerlab/dpeerlab-website/blob/master/biolearn.html, https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/dana-pe-er).

This version allow incorporation of a prior knowledge network that constrains the search space, which facilitates learning in a low sample size, high dimensional realm (i.e. problems in which # of variables outnumber the number of samples.)
